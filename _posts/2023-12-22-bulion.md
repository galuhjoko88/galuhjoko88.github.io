## Improvement in pure gold bar final purification (dore bullion smelting)

Smelting is a process of applying heat and a chemical reducing agent to an ore to extract a desired base metal product. Basically gold smelting process are relatively straight forward which you can refer to this article (https://www.bullionbypost.co.uk/index/gold/gold-smelting/). To make this article short, the scope of the smelting process that I involved at that time in LM Antam Pulo Gadung can be described in high level view as : 
1. Thermal treatment (including addition of flux and any other chemicals needed to purify the gold) 
2. Pure gold cast
3. Cooling (option available at that time: water, chemical, ambient air)
4. Weighing of pure gold bullion (99.9999% purity)

The conventional thermal treatment timeframe poses a significant challenge from a metallurgical perspective, and its intricacies surpass my expertise. The prescribed duration for the process, as per ISO procedures we must oversee, stands at 3 hours for a single small crucible containing approximately 200 kilograms of pure gold. Altering this process, however, is not feasible due to ISO compliance requirements.

The subsequent and most time-consuming phase involves the cooling process. Each cooling cycle, employing multiple large fans to minimize pure gold losses, takes approximately 4-5 hours per crucible. During idle periods, waiting for bullion bars to cool off, I recognized a significant inefficiency where I was essentially wasting 2-3 hours on average. After these wait times, the weighing process ensued, with a standard duration of 30-40 minutes for each crucible. Observing the prolonged cooling duration, I initiated an inquiry into potential enhancements. Through iterative analysis, I discerned suboptimal air-exposed surface areas for the bullion bars and identified uncoordinated fan placements, leading to inefficient heat exchange.

Upon obtaining permission from the expat overseeing the superintending activity, I conducted modifications to trial the improvements. As shown in the above figure, Firstly, I adjusted the placement of the bullion, and secondly, I organized the trays based on completion batches, directing fans towards the earlier batches as a priority. This strategic adjustment accelerated the cooling time for the initial batches, expediting the weighing process. The outcome of this simple yet impactful modification was a reduction in the waiting time waste from 3-4 hours to a mere 0.3-0.6 hours. The overall process completion time decreased from 8 hours to 5 hours, leading to a noteworthy reduction in overtime costs from 21 hours FTE to 0 hours FTE. The total investment required for this improvement amounted to IDR 0. Despite its simplicity, the impact of this modification proved to be significant in terms of savings.
