## Condition highlight

This scenario is just one among numerous similar cases I've encountered in past organizational settings. The prevalent and buzzworthy theme in this context is digitalization. A department express the desire to create an application to streamline their operations, involving four distinct departments in the project. The project's scope is of medium scale, and various vendors have been solicited for bids on application development. The lowest bid amounted to 450 million IDR, with an estimated annual maintenance cost of 100 million IDR.

Upon finalizing their development objectives, I was invited to contribute my expertise and guidance to the project. In tackling such initiatives, I consistently initiate the process with current process mapping, commencing with business process mapping and subsequently employing Value Stream Mapping (VSM), as depicted in the accompanying image. This systematic approach aids in comprehensively understanding and optimizing the existing processes before embarking on application development.

For those well-versed in scrutinizing process flowcharts, the identification of workflow inefficiencies is a common skill. However, to provide greater clarity, let's further explore the Value Stream Mapping (VSM) below, aiming to foster a more accessible comprehension.

Scrutinizing both the process flowchart and Value Stream Mapping (VSM), numerous inefficiencies within the process become apparent. Notably, there are instances of redundant document inputting to generate distinct reports. Additionally, specific datasets are reserved and utilized exclusively for month-end reporting purposes. As I delved into the business process and VSM, I conducted straightforward calculations and measurements.

My initial evaluation of the project based on the process flow mapping suggests its infeasibility, signaling that maintaining the current state might be a more judicious decision than proceeding with application development. The identified redundancies and suboptimal processes underscore the imperative for a meticulous reassessment of the project's viability before contemplating implementation.

It is evident that from a financial perspective, the digitalization project will not yield any additional value for the organization. Despite arguments suggesting intangible benefits, it is crucial to assess the project's impact on higher-level organizational capabilities. For a mining owner organization, 7 key aspects such as agility, knowledge acquisition, innovation, company identity, collaboration, efficiency, and strategic objectives play a pivotal role in success.

In the context of this specific mining project, essential aspects like agility, knowledge, and innovation may not be adequately addressed. Agility, for instance, is compromised due to the volatile nature of royalty and penalty calculation procedures, susceptible to changes in government policy that could escalate investment costs significantly. Considering PESTEL conditions, efficiency is vital in the mining industry, yet the evaluation indicates that the project might not contribute to increased efficiency. Collaboration through applications is achievable, but existing tools like Google Sheets already facilitate collaboration with less rigidity.

Strategic objectives, encompassing the potential of the business itself, are hindered by various uncontrolled variables, limiting the growth of production size. The mine site faces restrictions, with the maximum increase in capacity capped at 10-15% of the current capacity regardless the reserves that is had. Despite the potential positive impact on company identity or branding, branding alone may not justify greenlighting the project.


### Result

In order to enhance efficiency and contribute substantial business value to the organization, I facilitated the creation of a set of macro-enabled Google Sheets. This achievement involved developing five distinct Google Sheet files tailored to specific roles within the department. In a span of just three working days, accompanied by several hours of meticulous demonstrations and rigorous testing, this powerful tool was crafted. Impressively, these files are currently actively utilized. To further amplify visibility, I went a step further by crafting a straightforward yet effective dashboard, seamlessly embedded using shared iframes in Google Sheets. This strategic addition enables any level of management to effortlessly monitor the real-time quality performance of shipping operations.

By utilizing the insights gleaned from the Value Stream Mapping (VSM), we ascertain a notable **enhancement in Process Cycle Efficiency (PCE), escalating from 15.5% to an impressive 25.5%**. Through the application of Lean and Kaizen methodologies and the implementation of a straightforward tool, **non-value-added activities witnessed a remarkable reduction of 67.8%**, while **value-added activities experienced a commendable surge of 47.1%. All these improvement also brought increase of some information delivery previously weekly and monthly to be daily**. This successful endeavor underscores the effectiveness of embracing simplicity with the mantra "Keep it simple, silly (KISS)" reinforcing the idea that simplicity may not be flashy and hard to show-off in linkedin :) but holds the potential to save your company significant financial resources. Do not forget that this improvement must be kept sustain to generate real business value.

The digitalization project seems to offer limited value to the organization, primarily in terms of branding or company image. This strongly highlight the necessity for a comprehensive evaluation of digitalization initiatives to discern their future benefits. Not all digitalization projects justify the investment, and in certain cases, maintaining the status quo may be a more prudent decision than proceeding with the projects. Careful consideration and evaluation are imperative to ensure that digitalization efforts align with the organization's long-term goals and objectives.
