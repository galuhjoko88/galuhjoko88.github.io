# Project Acceptability 

The business impact of a solution is greatly contingent on both the quality and acceptability of that solution. In simpler terms, the business benefits or the **value added (VA)** a solution provides can be defined as a function of the solution's quality (Q) and its acceptance (A) by the project's stakeholders, particularly those who have direct involvement with the solution. This aspect of project acceptance encompasses sustainability, ensuring that the solution endures over the long term and consistently delivers the intended positive benefits. In essence, the ultimate value derived from a solution is a product of its effectiveness and the degree to which it aligns with stakeholders' needs and sustains its impact.

Value Added (VA) = Quality + Acceptability

From a Six Sigma perspective, it's noteworthy that only a relatively modest portion, roughly 20% to 30%, of the value generated by a solution can be attributed to its quality. Project Acceptability assumes a far more influential role in driving value creation from a solution.

Indeed, without the acceptance of a project, there is no guarantee that any value generated will be sustained or that the expected benefits, be it in the form of ROI, NPV, or IRR, will materialize. In such cases, the investment allocated to the solution could be deemed wasteful and unproductive. Conversely, subpar solution quality can lead to inefficiencies, resulting in resource wastage and added strain on operations. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of both solution quality and project acceptability is vital for maximizing value and ensuring the successful and efficient implementation of projects.

From a different perspective, specifically within the **IIBA community** where I actively participate, the body of knowledge of IIBA (BABOK) strongly emphasizes that a solution must be implemented to deliver tangible business value to the organization. It is insufficient to solely create solutions and deliver them to the process owner. In any business domain, the true business value is derived through the actual implementation, whether it pertains to process applications, manufacturing processes, or any other processes that directly contribute value to customers.

Regrettably, I've observed numerous instances where change management efforts are primarily fixated on the initial implementation of changes, often disregarding their sustained viability. From my own experience, I've come across several tools that can significantly enhance the probability of project acceptance. While some of these methods may be well-known, especially within established organizations, this article will delve into two specific approaches employed in past projects: ADKAR and stakeholder analysis. These frameworks are user-friendly and exceptionally practical for adoption within organizational contexts.


## Stakeholder Analysis
Stakeholder analysis is a crucial component of project management, change management, and strategic planning, helping organizations navigate complexities and ensure that decisions align with the broader interests of those involved. Stakeholder analysis constitutes a strategic management procedure encompassing the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of individuals, groups, or entities wielding substantial influence or susceptibility to impact a project, decision, or initiative. Its aim is to comprehensively grasp the interests, requirements, expectations, and sway of these stakeholders. By doing so, it facilitates adept relationship management, fostering effective collaboration and steering the project toward success. This systematic examination plays a pivotal role in aligning decisions with the overarching interests of those involved, emphasizing the intricate interplay between stakeholders and the outcomes of the undertaken endeavor.

### Influence Impact Matrix
Maintaining positive working relationships universally is essential, especially in certain projects necessitate vigilant oversight and thorough communication with specific individuals. This precautionary approach is vital to ensure the project stays on course and to avert any unforeseen complications or unwanted incidents during implementation and sustaining the improvement results. The matrix provides insight into potential bottlenecks within the project, highlighting individuals whose careful management is crucial to prevent disruptions and uphold the project's integrity. This strategic vigilance helps in steering the project effectively, mitigating risks, and fostering a smoother progression in line with intended objectives. 

The Influence Impact Matrix, alternatively termed the Power Interest Grid, serves as a graphical instrument in stakeholder analysis, facilitating the evaluation and ranking of stakeholders by gauging their influence and interest levels in a project or decision. Its application aids project managers and teams in pinpointing crucial stakeholders and customizing communication and engagement approaches. By visually plotting stakeholders on this matrix, it streamlines the identification of key players, allowing for nuanced strategies that align with the varied levels of influence and interest. This strategic tool proves invaluable in optimizing stakeholder management, fostering effective communication, and enhancing project outcomes.

### Communication Plan
This is important part after stakeholder mapping/ analysis. At the early of my carreer I was though that this part is just a formality in a project. But after experiencing several up and down in projects, I realize that this part is very important because it can *prevent surprise issues, prevent duplication, administer corrective action*. Especially in organization big enough that create invisible and unintended silos, communication plan became more critical. 

Communication plan developed in the early stage after stakeholder mapping. Communication plan typically include communication objective, target audiences, key content, method and frequency. Additionally, i believe that some personal approach needed depends on whether you are dealing with organization of different formality and power distance. Table below is an example of communication plan i used in an HSE automation project.


## ADKAR

In my opinion this is one of the most straight forward approach for change management initiatives program planning, suitable for those in organization that emphasize the practicality. The acronym "ADKAR" represents the five key building blocks or stages of the model:

A. Awareness: During this phase, individuals are guided to develop an awareness of the necessity for change, addressing the query, "Why is the change essential?" The goal is to foster an understanding among individuals, enabling them to recognize the imperative for change and comprehend the underlying reasons driving it.
D. Desire: Once individuals are cognizant of the impending change, it is imperative for them to cultivate a willingness or incentive to endorse and actively engage in the change. This phase centers around the inquiry, "What are the personal benefits?" Cultivating individual motivation contributes to cultivating a favorable attitude toward the change.
K. Knowledge: In this step, individuals attain the essential knowledge and expertise required for the successful execution of the change. The emphasis is on addressing the query, "How can I effect change?" Furnishing appropriate training and information becomes pivotal in this stage.
A. Ability: Expanding upon acquired knowledge, individuals must now develop the capacity to integrate the change into their daily work routines. This stage delves into the pragmatic dimension of change, guaranteeing that individuals can proficiently execute new processes or behaviors.
R. Reinforcement: Solidifying the change for long-term sustainability is the focus here. This addresses the query, "How can I maintain the change?" This phase encompasses acknowledgment, incentives, and continuous support, all aimed at ingraining the change into the fabric of the organization's culture. 

In six-sigma prespective, this step result can be measured using tool control chart. This means that every changes and expected result must be defined and controlled accordingly. 

The following table are example of ADKAR plan that I used in my previous projects in HSE automation combined with six sigma approach to ensure that changes and benefit with relevant business values are sustained.

In theory, ADKAR does not incorporate control charts, nor does it introduce measurement metrics to monitor the change acceleration process. Metrics and control charts are typically employed within the realm of Six Sigma to oversee and track the progress of improvement initiatives. In this project, the application is quite similar. We aim to ensure the consistent utilization of the solution to realize the anticipated business value. Ultimately, this approach aids in achieving milestones such as the Break-Even Point (BEP), Net Present Value (NPV), and Return on Investment (ROI), allowing for the realization of the project's investment objectives.
